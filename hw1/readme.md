### Install

Notice you need a virtual enviroment with Python3.5.

If using MAC, refer to this 
[link](http://www.andrewclegg.org/tech/TensorFlowLaptopCPU.html)

    pip install keras_applications
    # (optional) install tensorflow through source code
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install sklearn
    pip install h5py
    mkdir cloning_policy
    mkdir expert_data



### Run

Refer to the hw1.bash. Thus

    ./hw1.bash

Notice, we use source ./bin/activate in hw1.bash to avoid the environmental issues.

2-2.png and 3-2.png will be generated in the workspace folder. But the plot is static preset by my runtime result. 



### Reference
