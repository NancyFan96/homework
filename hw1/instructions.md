### Install

Notice you need a virtual enviroment with Python3.5.

If using MAC, refer to this 

[link]: http://www.andrewclegg.org/tech/TensorFlowLaptopCPU.html

```
pip install keras_applications
# (optional) install tensorflow through source code
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install sklearn
pip install h5py
```



### Run

Refer to the `hw1.bash`. Thus

```bash
./hw1.bash
```

Notice, we use ```source ./bin/activate``` in ```hw1.bash``` to avoid the environmental issues.

```2-2.png``` and ```3-2.png``` will be generated in the workspace folder. But the plot is static preset by my runtime result.
